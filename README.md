## About this repository

This repository contains an implementation of *Conway's Game of Life* in *Go*. I was very curious about this language, so I decided to write something more ambitious than *Hello World App*.

## Current state

The environment is currently not configurable. I want to add a couple of features such as providing a world size, providing a seed by options and step by step view with history states.
